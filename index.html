            <h1>This is Why You NEVER Ignore Bad Capacitors!</h1>
            <h2>What is the legend behind the badcaps?</h2>

            <p class="information"> Well, the rather dubious story behind this problem is that a scientist working
                for the Japanese company Rubycon left the company and began working for
                Luminous Town Electric in China. He developed a copy of the Rubycon P-50
                water based electrolyte which is what they use in the Low-ESR caps that are
                present on all motherboards. Unfortunately his staff left and stole his electrolyte formula.
                They started producing tons of the electrolyte and supplied many Taiwanese capacitor
                manufacturers. Unfortunately the formula was incomplete and did not contain the additives
                that prevent electrolysis from occurring inside the capacitors and releasing hydrogen gas
                which bursts the capacitor at the vents at the top or at the bottom of the capacitor can.

            </p>
             <h2 >Should we believe this legend?</h2>
            <p class="information">It is a plausible explanation for the problems which we have been having.
                However there are also other issues concerning inferior manufacture of capacitors.
                You have to consider what a capacitor is. It is not an incredibly complicated thing
                to construct, you could source from third parties the Aluminium Foils, Electrolyte,
                Leads, Bungs, Aluminium Cans, Sleeves and buy some machines to put it all together.
                You would not have the same knowledge as the majors who spend huge amounts on research
                and development however. You would also be relying on other peoples' quality control and
                choices of raw materials. Then each step of the production process and quality control
                that you could eliminate would cut costs and by selecting cheaper suppliers of components
                you could achieve a product which is priced well to compete with other capacitor manufacturers.
                Of course the product would not be of comparable quality to that of the majors and that is
                why they are much more expensive.

            <p class="caption">Isn't that the result of a failure instead of the cause?
                I've seen "unrolled" caps where the metal cover came totally off in failed
                PSUs - the voltage goes too high and the cap explodes.</p>

                My old Soyo motherboard only uses Sacon caps and
                it never functioned properly out of the box (apg x8 mode).
                I personally will never buy anything made by them again.</p>

            <p class="caption">Worst cap meltdown I ever saw was from an old cheap mobo
                when I used to work at PC Club. Had a computer come in that wouldn't post,
                pulled the panel, and on the side of the board (the side that sits at the bottom,
                a cap blew, and caught fire. Burnt up the motherboard, taking out the ram,
                and several of the IDE cables along the way. Was pretty impressive.</p>

                having a lifespan limit then Microsoft should have
                warned buyers in the manual in a prominent location or,
                better yet, should have figured out another way to keep time â€” like a battery.</p>

                try ramming in 12,5mm 16V/3300uF Panasonic FM.
                Those have similar or the same value than the Nichicon.
                Problem: they are way bigger. And the only caps, to my knowledge,
                that are widely available and can be used as replacement of
                Nippon Chemicon KZG and similar..</p>
